## 0.8.1

### Minor Changes

- 13e8e5a: # Release 0.8.0

  - **Snippet Fixes**: Resolved ESLint parsing errors in virtual TypeScript files within Markdown, Astro, and VitePress code blocks by disabling type-aware rules for those snippets.
  - **Standalone TS Support**: Restored `disableTypeChecked` configuration in the TypeScript package, ensuring it remains fully functional and parsing-error-free when used without the main composer.
  - **Documentation Reorganization**: Significantly expanded and restructured the documentation site, adding new pages for the Inspector, CLI Tooling, Extensions, and better framework-specific guides.
  - **Branding Update**: Updated the author link label from "Website" to "Author" across all documentation files for improved brand identity.
  - **Composition Improvements**: Refactored the configuration composer to be more robust when handling virtual snippets and framework contracts.
